You may be asking yourself; what the hell is this guy talking about?! Haven't
this idiot heard of (insert-latest-world-ending, apocalyptic-super-cyber-threat-here)?!
We'll yes, yes I have, every day in fact.

Part of my duties at work is to find the latest cyber-threats around the world to
brief the big wigs in a non-technical manner, so I'm plenty aware of all the threats and
what is next to come. But listen, you and I are not targets, we are not that important to
anyone; unless you're a CEO or CFO, own a company affiliated with banks, the stock market
or have some juicy government contract, otherwise, you're not an important target for
anyone. And no, going to your local cafe and jumping on their network without a
VPN is not a high-spy thriller life.

So why am I telling you never to update your operating system or programs? I'm
not. I'm just telling why I have never updated or patch my Windows OS or programs I use.
There are several reasons why, which I'll here cover soon, but just to let you know, I
have never, EVER updated my operating systems...not once starting with Windows XP SP2. And
yes you'll be saying, but Sal...SP2 is an update! Yes it is,but SP2 actually fixed a lot
of limitations XP SP1 had and not major security patches due to a zero-day exploits. Security
updates and critical patches never made it to any of my systems throughout the years and I'll
tell you why now.

First case: Unsupported Software.

The first things I've noticed throughout my 25+ years of fixing and SOHO
networks and troubleshooting computers is that when you update you not only "fix"
problems that may or may not actually affect you, but sometimes the updates do
more than just fix the issues...they create new ones.

Have you ever seen a program that no longer works after an update of the operating
system? No? Have you heard of the Apple iPad? Yeah you have! Every time Apple decides
to update the operating system the program or game also needs to be updated or is
no longer supported by the latest version of the operating system. Sometimes you
have to wait for an update of that game or application, and sometimes the developers
give up trying to catch up and your favorite software is no longer carried.

And other times, you may have to buy it again, but that is not only something Apple
does, Microsoft is also known to have done this as well as other manufacturers.
Additionally, some software developers have also been known to try the no-longer
-supported trap that makes you buy that application you've been using free for years.

I've had some issues with these with Windows programs. One day they decide to update
and now I need to pay for something that was free or have an account for some stupid
reason for a program that is in my own hard drive. All they did was "fix bugs", or
update the GUI. Nothing really was needed. Maybe it looked boring, but it worked.

Second case: Format no longer supported.

Going from my last statement is the no-longer-free issue. That cool and nifty program
you were using for years now is no longer supported by the new operating system, or,
now the program you updated thinking you may get some new functionality is no longer
free. Yet another issues is that after updating the program the developers changed the
format the files were saved and all your old files are no longer compatible with the
updated program.

If it's a program that many people have used, it's popular and people are complaining
about the updated version, see if you can try to find it the old one again...it probably
was taken down and removed from all possible websites on behest of the developer just
so you are pushed to buy the new version of it. The dangerous part of this is, if
it's a popular application that can no longer be found, malicious actors may have
an infected copy for all to get infected from. So my take on this is, always make a
backup of all your software or at least have multiple backups of your hard drive
because it's not "if they break", it's "when they break" and they will break sooner
or later.

Third case: Backdoors.

This one is not just me people...nope...it's something real that has been in the news several
times through the years. Hard drives or motherboards that come from the manufacturer with
hidden code (Samsung), to which no one knows how it got there and no news agency does a
follow-up report about and one that allows backdoors to millions of computers.

Law agencies requesting backdoor access to smartphones and other smart-devices is
a yearly occurrence. It's not just me, it's a real thing happening all over
the field, especially software code that is created in module fashion, then used by
different developers which use it in order to save time during their developing
but don't know what the code really does. You can go ahead and look at cyber-related
news like CYWARE, Googlenews, TheHackerNews or TheRegister...go ahead...I'll wait. Spend a
week looking at some news reports and then you'll see what I mean.

So, there it is. I have never updated or patched any of my computers. Not XP, not
Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10. But, I have however updated my only Linux computer and
before you start losing your mind, let me explain. With Linux I have never had a
problem with any slowing of hardware after an update or a program that I've used
suddenly is no longer supported, no longer developed, or the program changed formats
on me like Microsoft programs tend to do. That Linux system is five years old and
still working like a charm.

So right about now you're asking yourself, but what about viruses and such? Have
you ever had any problems with them? Then answer is yes. But not because I was a
target, more so because I downloaded something that was infected. This is nothing
that a good anti-virus, or safe-mode and a few hours of technical support on my
part can't fix. But never because I was a target of some nefarious plot to steal
my PayPal account and withdraw my $17.09 left in balance.

One last thing before I close.

Remember I mention to keep backups of your software? Yes, definitely do that.
When I download a free program that I get lots of productivity from I always back
them up. I create a monthly or quarterly backup of all programs I've used since
Windows 95 and still have them all just in case. But do I update them? First, I have
to check what the updates "fix" or does for me. Is the update going to give me
something that I need or is it just to fix something on it to be more compatible
with the next update of the operating system (i.e. Windows 10 fix, but you're
running Windows 7). Then the answer is no, I will not update.

Also, if you read the list of changes on any given program and it reads "several
bug fixes" then be wary because they're not being specific as to what they did.
It may not be anything, but it could be code for "we now have a backdoor to you."
On that same note, stay away from programs that all of a sudden now need an account
for them to work on YOUR computer. Prior to 2015, nothing needed an account to run
from YOUR OWN hard drive and having an account provides a nice backdoor to you
through cookies or a through an open port on the firewall and one way to maintain
persistence is to have a service that is always on in the background. FYI, to catch
sneaky programs like these that like to connect to a server somewhere in the world
while in the background use Glassware and it's free.

PS,
I do not update my third party programs which run perfect for me and give me no
issues (Case #1), but if you have a program that gives you problems then look to see
if it's good for you to update them. Go to their website and check the changes made.
Also save all your software. Get in the habit of doing this. Back them up because one
day they may no longer be available for your OS or be free.

Finally, I recommend stopping any programs from making callback for updates unless your
want to. Use firewall rules, Glasswire which makes Firewall rules for you, or better yet
block them with your HOSTS file. More on this on another post.
