You may be asking yourself; what in the hell is this guy talking about?! Haven't
this idiot heard of (insert latest world-ending, apocalyptic cyber threat here)?!
We'll yes, yes I have, every day in fact.

Part of my duties at work is to find the latest cyber-threats around the world to
brief the big bosses, so I'm plenty aware of all the threats and what is next to
come. But listen, you and I are not targets, we are not that important to anyone;
unless you're a CEO or CFO, own a company affiliated with banks, the stock market
or have some juicy government contract, otherwise, you're not an important target
for anyone. Unless you call going to your local cafe and jumping on their network
without a VPN--which is a big no-no--a high-spy thriller life.

So why am I telling you never to update your operating system or programs? I'm
not. I'm just telling why I have never updated or patch my Windows computers.
There are several reasons why, which I'll here cover soon, but just to let you
know, I have never, EVER updated my operating system...not once starting with
Windows XP SP2. And yes you'll be saying, but Sal...SP2 is an update! Yes it is,
but SP2 actually fixed a lot of limitations XP SP1 had and not security patches
due to a zero-day exploit. Security updates and critical patches never made it
to any of the multiple systems I've own throughout the years and I'll tell you why.

First case: Unsupported Software.

The first things I've noticed throughout my 25+ years of fixing and troubleshooting
computers is that when you update you not only "fix" problems that may or may not
actually affect you, but sometimes the updates do more than just fix the issues...
they make new ones.

Have you ever seen a program that no longer works after an update of the operating
system? No? Have you heard of the Apple iPad? Yeah you have! Every time Apple decides
to update the operating system the program or game also needs to be updated or is
no longer supported by the latest version of the operating system. Sometimes you
have to wait for an update of that game or application, and sometimes the developers
give up trying to catch up and your favorite software is no longer carried.

And other times, you may have to buy it again, but that is not only something Apple
does, Microsoft is also known to have done this as well as other manufacturers.
Additionally, some software developers have also been known to try the no-longer-supported
trap that makes you buy that application you've been using free for years.

Second case: Format no longer supported.

Going from my last statement is the no-longer-free issue. That cool and nifty program
you were using for years now is no longer supported by the new operating system, or,
now the program you updated thinking you may get some new functionality is no longer
free. Yet another issues is that after updating the program the developers changed the
format the files were saved and all your old files are no longer compatible with the
updated program.

If it's a program that many people have used, it's popular and people are complaining
about the updated version, see if you can try to find it the old one again...it probably
was taken down and removed from all possible websites on behest of the developer just
so you are pushed to buy the new version of it. The dangerous part of this is, if
it's a popular application that can no longer be found, malicious actors may have
an infected copy for all to get infected from. So my take on this is, always make a
backup of all your software or at least have multiple backups of your hard drive
because it's not "if they break", it's "when they break" and they will break sooner
or later.

Third case: Backdoors.

This one is not just my imagination people...nope...it's something that have been in
the news several times through the years. Hard drives or motherboards that come from
the manufacturer with hidden code--which no one knows how it got there and no news
agency do a follow-up report about---allowing backdoors to systems.

Law agencies requesting backdoor access to smartphones and other smart-devices is
a yearly occurrence. It's not just me, ok...it's a real thing happening all over
the field, especially software code that is created in module fashion, then spread
around to different developers which use in order to save time during developing
and don't know what the code really does. You can go ahead and look at cyber-related
news like CYWARE, TheHackerNews or TheRegister...go ahead...I'll wait. Spend a week
looking at some news reports and then you'll see what I mean.

Forth case: Slowing you down.

Another issue that many technology manufacturers are doing now is slowing your
hardware down so you'll end up upgrading. There is nothing wrong with your five
year old smartphone for example, this is just the effects of latest "security
update" that all the TV news are losing their ignorant minds about. You know, the
one that if you don't do it now, you're entire life will disappear into a
cyber-black-hole of binary 1s and 0s, and hackers will own your house, cat and
first child...so YOU MUST DO IT RIGHT NOW!!! Well, not really...and if you can help
it then don't do it. Again, you and I are not important targets, companies and
government agencies are.

Apple, Samsung and Tesla are the latest to be caught slowing their hardware down
with the excuse of trying to help your battery to last longer or in Tesla's case,
because you didn't pay the premium. If that's the case Apple, then let me replace
the battery and not the entire $600 device. No?! Then I'll stick with Android,
thanks.

So, there it is. I have never updated or patched any of my computers. Not XP, not
Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10. But, I have however updated my only Linux computer and
before you start losing your mind, let me explain. With Linux I have never had a
problem with any slowing of hardware after an update or a program that I've used
suddenly is no longer supported, no longer developed, or the program changed formats
on me like Microsoft programs tend to do. That Linux system is five years old and
still working like a charm.

So right about now you're asking yourself, but what about viruses and such? Have
you ever had any problems with them? Then answer is yes. But not because I was a
target, more so because I downloaded something that was infected. This is nothing
that a good anti-virus, or safe-mode and a few hours of technical support on my
part can't fix. But never because I was a target of some nefarious plot to steal
my PayPal account and withdraw my $17.09 left in balance.

One last thing before I close.

So remember I mention to keep backups of your software? Yes, definitely do that.
When I download a free program that I get lots of productivity from I always back
them up. I create a monthly or quarterly backup of all programs I've used since
Windows 95 and still have them all just in case. But do I update them? First, I have
to check what the updates "fix" or does for me. Is the update going to give me
something that I need or is it just to fix something on it to be more compatible
with the next update of the operating system (i.e. Windows 10 fix, but you're
running Windows 7).  Then the answer is no, I will not update.

Also, if you read the list of changes on any given program and it reads "several
bug fixes" then be wary because they're not being specific as to what they did.
It may not be anything, but it could be code for "we now have a backdoor to you."
On that same note, stay away from programs that all of a sudden now need an account
for them to work on YOUR computer. Prior to 2015, nothing needed an account to run
from your own hard drive and having an account could provide a nice backdoor to you
through cookies or a through an open port in the firewall that is always on in the
background and as a service. FYI, to catch sneaky programs like these that like to
connect to a server somewhere in the world while in the background use Glassware
...yep, it's free.

PS,
Forgot to mention this. I do not update my third party programs that run perfect
for me and give me no issues, but if you have a program that gives you issues then
look to see it's good for you to update them. I do not update any Microsoft programs
or utilities just in case they break and no longer work. For me, my setup is perfect
and I feel I do not need to introduce more problems to my life by "updating" them,
but that's my two-cents. Your two-cents may differ.
